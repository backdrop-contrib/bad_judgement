Bad Judgement
=============

Trust me. You shouldn't be enabling this module.

But if you do enable this module, you shouldn't be enabling the module that requires this module either.

So what does this module do exactly?
------------------------------------

This module provides an explicit dependency for modules whose usage requires bad judgement. Joke modules often require "bad judgement".

For example: Its probably a bad idea to install the “Who’s your daddy?” module since its possible to configure it to WSOD your website. That's why that module cannot be enabled before first downloading and enabling "bad judgement". That step should make you think twice about enabling “Who’s your daddy?”

Ironically, this module is actually a good idea, as it can prevent people from doing stupid things. Given that, should you enable it? Definitely not.
